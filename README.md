Mooi is a SCSS Framework designed to speed up development times, with Mooi you can wireframe a site in a matter of minutes by setting a few variables and then adding your own CSS to the StyleSheets.

Mooi has been designed, developed and created with users in mind, the concept is that nothing should be overly complicated and that by using this framework it will reduce the lines of code that you have to write, and let Mooi do the rest for you.
